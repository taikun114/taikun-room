/**
 * Title tags are deduplicated on the server using the HTMLRewriter interface.
 * This is not full deduplication. We simply skip rendering Page Setting title
 * if it has already been rendered using HeadSlot/HeadTitle.
 * To prevent React on the client from re-adding the removed title tag, we skip rendering them client-side.
 * This approach works because React retains server-rendered title tag as long as they are not re-rendered by the client.
 *
 * The following component behavior ensures this:
 * 1. On the server: Render title tag as usual.
 * 2. On the client: Before rendering, remove any title tag with the same `name` or `property` that were not rendered by Client React,
 *    and then proceed with rendering as usual.
